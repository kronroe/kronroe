## Summary

Kronroe is dual-licensed:

| Use case | Licence | Cost |
|---|---|---|
| Open-source projects, personal use, research, internal tooling where your stack is also open-source | [AGPL-3.0](./LICENSE) | Free |
| Commercial / proprietary software, SaaS, closed-source products | This Commercial Licence | Contact us |

If your use of Kronroe would require you to open-source your own code under the AGPL, you need a commercial licence instead.

## What requires a commercial licence?

You need a commercial licence if you are:

- Building a **proprietary application** (desktop, mobile, or server-side) that embeds Kronroe and is not released under the AGPL
- Running Kronroe as part of a **SaaS or hosted service** without releasing your full application stack under the AGPL
- Distributing Kronroe as part of a **commercial product or SDK** that your customers use without receiving AGPL source rights
- Using Kronroe in any context where AGPL copyleft obligations would be commercially impractical

All external contributors to Kronroe must sign a Contributor Licence Agreement (CLA) before their pull requests are merged. The CLA grants Kindly Roe Ltd the right to relicence contributed code, which is necessary to offer this dual-licence model. The CLA does not affect contributors' rights to use their own contributions under the AGPL.

**Kindly Roe** (the iOS and web application for SEND support coordination, developed by Rebekah Cole) is hereby granted a **perpetual, irrevocable, royalty-free commercial licence** to use, embed, and distribute Kronroe in any form, including proprietary builds, App Store releases, and any successor or related products under the Kindly Roe brand.

This exemption:
- Survives any future relicensing of Kronroe
- Applies to all versions of Kronroe past and future
- Includes all Kronroe crates (`kronroe`, `kronroe-agent-memory`, and any future crates in this workspace)
- Is personal to Rebekah Cole and the Kindly Roe product line; it is not transferable to third-party acquirers without separate written agreement
