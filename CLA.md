Subject to the terms of this CLA, you hereby grant to the Project Owner a **perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright licence** to:

- Reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, and distribute your Contributions
- Sublicense your Contributions to third parties under any licence, including proprietary licences
