# Kronroe

**Embedded temporal property graph database.**  
Bi-temporal facts as a first-class engine primitive — not an application concern.

> ⚠️ Early development. Not yet ready for use.

---

## What

Every existing embedded graph database treats time as your problem. You add `created_at` to your properties. You write `WHERE valid_at BETWEEN ...` queries. The database does not know that "Alice works at Acme" was true in 2023 and false in 2024.

Kronroe treats bi-temporal facts as a **type-level design primitive enforced by the storage engine**:

```rust
// Assert a temporal fact — valid time is part of the engine, not your schema
db.assert_fact("alice", "works_at", "Acme", Utc::now())?;

// Point-in-time query — first-class operation, not a WHERE clause trick
let employer = db.facts_at("alice", "works_at", date!(2024-03-01))?;

// Invalidation — old fact gets valid_to set; history is preserved, never deleted
db.invalidate_fact(&fact_id, Utc::now())?;
```

This is the DuckDB move. DuckDB did not "do SQLite better" — it said analytical queries deserve their own engine design. Kronroe says temporal knowledge evolution deserves its own graph engine design.

## Why now

Two use cases are completely unserved:

- **AI agent memory** — agents that need to remember, update, and query facts about the world over time, without running a server
- **Mobile/edge** — iOS and Android apps that need relationship graph capabilities without network latency or server infrastructure

The solutions developers reach for today (Graphiti + Neo4j, mcp-memory-service) require a running server, have no temporal model at the engine level, and do not run on mobile.

## Architecture

Pure Rust. No C dependencies in the core engine.
