# Branding Assets

This directory stores working branding artifacts that are not all used in production at once.

## Structure
- `TYPOGRAPHY.md`: design notes and type exploration.
- `source/`: source logo and favicon exploration files.

## Production usage
Production site assets should remain in `site/public/` and be referenced explicitly by `site/index.html`.
